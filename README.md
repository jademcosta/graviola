## Bugs and unimplemented features

These are shortcomings that will be implemented in next releases, but right now can't be used.

- Exemplars - No support at all
- Native histograms - no support at all
- Using query filters when querying for label values on API (this affects only the `/labels/values` and `labels/names` endpoints)
